The Driver (OceanExplorer) creates an OceanMap which builds a game board (gameGrid) and uses gridState to track each cell. 
I set up the board in this order: start with all WATER, place the player ship, then add islands, and finally add pirates. 
I use the Observer pattern here: the Ship is the subject and each pirateShip is an observerâ€”when the ship moves, it notifies the pirates and they react on their own.
This keeps ship input separate from pirate behavior and the UI, and makes it easy to change how many pirates there are or how they move.
